# Learning Python Inheritance
## Inheritance
========================
Inheriance  is a mechanism that allows you to create a hierarchy of classes that share a set of properties and methods by deriving a class from another class.
## Benefits of inheritance are:
1. It represents real-world relationships well.
2. It provides the reusability of a code.
3. It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A, then all the subclasses of B would automatically inherit from class A.
4. Inheritance offers a simple, understandable model structure.
5. Less development and maintenance expenses result from an inheritance.
