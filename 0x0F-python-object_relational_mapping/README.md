# Python ORM

Python ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) is a technique that lets you query and manipulate data from a database using an object-oriented paradigm. Instead of writing SQL queries directly, you define classes that represent tables in your database, and instances of these classes represent rows in those tables. The ORM library handles the translation of these objects and their interactions into the appropriate SQL queries.
Python ORM libraries, such as SQLAlchemy and Django's ORM, provide a high-level abstraction over the database, making it easier to work with databases in Python without needing to write raw SQL queries. They handle tasks like database connection management, query generation, and result set handling, allowing developers to focus more on the application's logic rather than the intricacies of the database interaction.
